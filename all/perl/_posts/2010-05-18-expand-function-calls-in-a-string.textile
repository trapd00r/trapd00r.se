<p> Normally when one wants to add a function call to a string variable,
the concatation operator '.' is used;</p>

{% highlight perl %}
my $foo = 'the time is ->'.scalar(localtime).' <- the time is';
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Little known is the fact that you can expand calls directly in a string:</p>

{% highlight perl%}
my $foo = "the time is -> @{[scalar(localtime)]} <- the time is";
{% endhighlight %}
