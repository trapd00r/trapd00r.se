<p>

I love xkcd; everybody does.
What I don't like is how you have to move the mouse cursor over the picture to see the hover text, which often is necessary for fully understanding the comic.
Since I don't use a mouse, for several reasons, I had to curl and grep; not very userfriendly, eh.

h3. App::xkcd

<p>
<strong>xkcd</strong> is a command-line interface to <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
View, download and enjoy comics straight from the comfortable shell. The mouse-over text is displayed when the image-viewing application exits for maximum amusement.
Called with zero arguments, the latest xkcd comic is displayed. The <strong>-c</strong> flag takes an (preferably valid) integer that corresponds to that particular xkcd comic number. The <strong>-a</strong> flag only displays the mouse-over text, while the <strong>-d</strong> flag downloads the comic to <strong>location</strong>.
</p>

A typical run might look like this:

{%highlight bash%}

> xkcd
Latest XKCD:
 It is not our fault we caught a group on their way home from a geography bee.
 And they taught us that Uzbekistan is one of the worlds two doubly-landlocked
 countries!

> xkcd -c 183 -a
 I am not making this rule up.
 Although my mom wants you all to know it made perfect sense at the time.

> xkcd -d .
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/world_according_to_americans.png
  => ./world_according_to_americans.png

> xkcd -c 193 -d .

  => ./193-the_perfect_sound.png
