p. The upgrade from Perl 5.10 to 5.12.1 in Arch have caused a lot of headache. I had to manually rebuild almost 600 modules and a lot of regular users are frustrated due to the suddenly changed perl-bin-path, from the sane */usr/bin/perlbin* path to hiding them in */usr/lib*. What the fuck...

p. I've searched, asked and questioned this decision for a couple of months now, to no avail. The path problem isn't hard to fix, though.

p. First, use *pacman* to see where it actually installed things:

{% highlight bash%}
$ pacman -Ql colorcoke-git|grep bin
colorcoke-git /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/bin/
colorcoke-git /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/bin/colorcoke
{% endhighlight %}

p. Right. Add that (and the other missing dirs as well) to your $PATH in .bashrc or similar.

{% highlight bash %}
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/bin:/usr/lib/perl5/core_perl/bin:/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/bin
{% endhighlight %}

p. Use *hash -r* (bash) or *rehash* (zsh), and the PATH will be rehashed for executables.

{% highlight bash %}
$ which colorcoke
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/bin/colorcoke
{% endhighlight %}
