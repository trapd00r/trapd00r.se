Tired of having unwanted configs, directories and bloat messing with your home dir?

So was I.

<a href="http://github.com/trapd00r/rmshit">rmshit</a> uses <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify">inotify</a> to watch your $HOME (or, alternatively, any other dir) for
unwanted files and instantly deletes them. Since it's a daemon, you can start
it at boot time and know that'll keep your directories clean.

<strong>To install the dependencies: </strong>

{% highlight bash %}
cpan Linux::Inotify2 Working::Daemon
{% endhighlight %}

<i>or use your package manager of choice.</i>

<strong>To install rmshit: </strong>

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/trapd00r/rmshit.git
cd rmshit
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
{% endhighlight %}

You might want to edit the <strong>@shittyfiles</strong> array, containing unwanted files and dirs. 
It looks like this right now:

{% highlight perl %}
my @shittyfiles = qw(.dbus
                     .gconf
                     .gconfd
                     .links
                     .lynx
                     .local
                     .Xauthority
                     .dmenu_cache
                     .fmenu_cache
                     .esd_auth
                     .fehrc
                     .xsel.log
                     .ncmpcpp
                     Desktop
                     .adobe
                     .macromedia
                   );
{% endhighlight %}
