h3. History

p. In the beginning, there were 8 colors. Soon this was extended to 16, the added 8 was supposed to be either just the same colors with an added bold attribute, or 'bright' versions of the first 8, depending on implementation.
Known as the *ANSI colors*, these could be freely modified by loading X resources and respawning the terminal.

p. Along came rxvt-unicode that offered an amazing 88 colors.

p. Xterm followed by supporting 256, but none of this could be modified.
You simply were stuck with what some dude thought were a good selection of colors.

p. Now that a lot of applications support more then the regular ANSI colors, they actually serve a purpose. Therefore it's quite sad that one can *not* modify them.

p. Right. So *let's do it anyway.*

p. *colorcoke* lets one modify the whole range of colors for a running terminal session.


p. The changes will take effect immediately - no need to spawn a new terminal or (ab)use the xrdb tool.

p. Shades and tints can be generated for specific ranges - you could leave the
ANSI colors untouched while going for a matrix-like green shading for colors
32-60, a deep purple theme for 102-200, and completely randomizing the rest.

p. The randomness can be modified as well. If you dont like green, just use something like this:

{%highlight perl%}

colorcoke --random -rr 200 -rb 190 -rg 0

{%endhighlight%}

p. The main feature of *colorcoke* is the one that generates tints and shades though.
This works by giving it a color to start with (the default is #000000, pitch black).
By using simple math we can do things like this:

<img src="http://psy.trapd00r.se/scrots/colorcoke/colorcoke-shades2.png">

p. This was generated by

{%highlight perl%}
colorcoke -c 000000 -r 2 -g 1 -b 1 -s 0 -e 255
{%endhighlight%}

p. You might notice that color 7, 15 and 232 doesn't quite fit in there.
Those reside in the array of colors to ignore - I use 232 as my terminal background color, and 7 and 15 are the default foreground colors.

p. The -s and -e flag specify start and end index, respectively. To simply generate standard ANSI colorschemes, one might try

{%highlight perl%}
colorcoke --random -s 0 -e 15 -rg 0 -rb 200
{%endhighlight%}

p. Which might give us something like
