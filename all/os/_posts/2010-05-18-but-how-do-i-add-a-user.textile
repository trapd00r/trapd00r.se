<p>Yesterday I was approached with a interesting problem.</p>
<p>
This guy simply couldn't write the 'd' char anymore. To see if it was software
or hardware related, he was about to add a new user to try with. 
He was confused how to add a new user though, since *adduser*, *useradd* and
*/etc/passwd* all have the 'd' char in it.
</p>

<p>There's a couple more or less interesting ways to solve this.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
usera + [tab]
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
/usr/sbin/usera??
{% endhighlight %}

<p> And the little more interesting way...</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$(perl -e 'printf("a%s%suser\n",  chr('100') x 2);')
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
What this does is actually pretty simple.
We print a 'a', two 'd' using the chr() function, 'user', and since we wrapped it
all in $(), it executes in the shell, and voil√°!
</p>
