h3. JAPH

p. Yes, that's right. *Just Another Perl Hacker*.

p. I consider myself a free software advocate, hacker and geek. Besides reading
perldoc I enjoy writing Perl code and fixing other peoples bad Perl code.

p. I also enjoy system administration (GNU/Linux, BSD), and I'm quite fluent in the
shell. I enjoy it even more if there's a recent Perl version installed, since
that allows me to cheat.

p. I'm trying to live by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a> and the old UNIX pragma 'do one
thing, and do it well', not that anyone else does nomore.

p. Music is what makes this life worth living. I'm constantly on the lookout for
new amazing artits. I'm also trying to find new ways to enjoy the music.
<a href="http://github.com/trapd00r/pimpd">I might have succeeded</a>.

h3. Work

p. I'm currently employed by the local newspaper, doing nothing related to
programming at all. Would you like to help me change this? Then take a look at
my <a href="http://japh.se/cv.pdf">Curriclum Vitae</a> [PDF].

h3. Contact

p. The best way to contact me would be by sending me an email. I'd accept XMPP
requests as well, though. See the bottom of this page.
